== Shell completion

The Axlib cli command supports shell auto-completion. For this to work, you will need to run the completion script matching you build and system.

Assuming you built a release version using `cargo build --release` and use `bash` run the following:

[source, shell]
source target/release/completion-scripts/axlib.bash

You can find completion scripts for:
- bash
- fish
- zsh
- elvish
- powershell

To make this change persistent, you can proceed as follow:

.First install

[source, shell]
----
COMPL_DIR=$HOME/.completion
mkdir -p $COMPL_DIR
cp -f target/release/completion-scripts/axlib.bash $COMPL_DIR/
echo "source $COMPL_DIR/axlib.bash" >> $HOME/.bash_profile
source $HOME/.bash_profile
----

.Update

When you build a new version of Axlib, the following will ensure you auto-completion script matches the current binary:

[source, shell]
----
COMPL_DIR=$HOME/.completion
mkdir -p $COMPL_DIR
cp -f target/release/completion-scripts/axlib.bash $COMPL_DIR/
source $HOME/.bash_profile
----
